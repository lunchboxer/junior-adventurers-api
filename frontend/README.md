# Junior Adventurer

![alt text](https://github.com/lunchboxer/junior-adventurer/blob/main/frontend-dist/mountains-banner.jpg?raw=true)

This svelte-based site is static ready to be uploaded to a static site option of your choice with a simple...

```sh
npm run build
```

At that point the `build` directory is ready to be the root directory of the domain.

The build process relies on snowpack to compile the svelte source files found in `src` and the mostly unchanged static files in `public`

It doesn't yet do anything useful.
